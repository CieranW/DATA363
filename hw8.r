# HW 8 - Random Variables and Distribution Functions
# 3
# A Gumbel random variable X has the distribution function F_x(x) = exp(-e^-x)

# 3.1 - Calculate the First Quartile (Solve for F_x(x) = 0.25)

# 3.2 - Distribution Function Graph
# Plot graph of F_x(x), indicating the first and third quartile, and median as points on the graph

# 3.3 - Probability Transform
# Determine the probability transform for this distribution, writing x as a function of u

# 3.4 - Simulating Gumbel Random Variables
# Use the value found in 3.3 to create 80 samples with this distribution. Plot the graph that shows the true cumulative distribution function (in black) along with the emperical CDF of the data (different color)

# 3.5 - Density Function
# Determine the probability density function f_x(x) for the cumulative distribution function F_x(x)
